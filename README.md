Intro to Web Development Final HTML/CSS Project

Basic Concept: Create a page for our weekly Monday happy hour meet ups (referred to as "Mo' Mondays Mo' Problems").  Allow members of the page to suggest a venue for the upcoming Monday (multiple suggestions can be posted), perhaps embed yelp information for venue that are suggested.  Allow other members to vote on the suggested venues.  After a certain deadline (say 6 hours before the event), voting will be locked and the venue with the most votes will be selected.  Automatically email members to inform them of the chosen location and event details.  This concept can be utilized for any event that a member wants to create (e.g. birthday party).
