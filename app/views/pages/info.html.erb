	<p>MoMondays is a web application that democratizes event planning. If you're having
	 trouble choosing a venue for your upcoming event, why not let your guests decide??
	 All you need to do is create an event, specify the date, and choose a time for the voting 
	 to start.  After the event is created, your guests have up until the voting start
	 time to suggest venues for your event. You can even suggest your own venues to the list.
	 When the voting begins, venues can no longer
	 be suggested and people can begin to vote on the venue they prefer for your event.
	 There are a few rules that need to be followed whether you are the event creator, 
	 venue suggestor, or just a voter:
