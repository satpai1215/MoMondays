	<h2>Mo' Mondays Mo' What?</h2>
	<p>MoMondays is a web application that democratizes event planning. The application takes
		stress out of choosing an event location by allowing your guests to decide for you.
	 All you need to do is create an event, specify the date, and choose a time for the voting 
	 to start.  After the event is created, your guests have up until the voting start
	 time to suggest venues for your event. You can even suggest your own venues to add the list.
	 When the voting begins, venues can no longer be suggested and people can begin to vote on the 
	 venue they prefer for your event. Here are the steps:
