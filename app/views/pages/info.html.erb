		<h2>Mo' Mondays Mo' What?</h2>
		<p>MoMondays is a social event-planning application that allows your guests to suggest.
		 All you need to do is create an event, specify the date, and choose a time for the voting 
		 to close.  After the event is created, your guests have up until the close of the voting period to suggest venues for your event or vote for venues. You can even suggest your own venues to add the list. When voting ends, the venue with the most votes will be chosen and an email will be sent out with event details
